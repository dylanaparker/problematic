Simple Problem Solving Using Ruby
=================================
##### A collection of simple problems to solve and my solutions.
###### *I may also find solutions in other languages after I've completed them using Ruby.*

1. As tradition requires, say "Hello" to the world!

2. Create a program that asks the user their name and greets them with their name.

3. Modify the previous program to only greet user if their name is either "Alice" or "Steve"

4. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n *i.e. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6*

5. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17

6. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n.

7. Write a program that prints times tables for a user selected number and length.

8. Write a program that prints a user selected amount of prime numbers.

9. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. I counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

10. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
