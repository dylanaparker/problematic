1. As tradition requires, say "Hello" to the world!

2. Create a program that asks the user their name and greets them with their name.

3. Modify the previous program to only greet user if their name is either "Alice" or "Steve"

4. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n *i.e. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6*
